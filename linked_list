    Initializes an empty linked list.

    This method is only responsible for setting up an empty list with no nodes.
    Nodes should be added later using another method (append() for example).

    `first` and `last` are instance variables to ensure that each LinkedList
    object maintains its own state. Defining them as class variables would
    cause all LinkedList instances to share the same references, which would
    break the behavior of independent linked lists.
